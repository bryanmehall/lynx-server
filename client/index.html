            Lynx is a general purpose programming language designed to re-think what it means to code from first principles.
            <h1>Why not code? </h1>
            Traditional text-based coding is the standard that almost every general purpose programming language uses because of its expressive power and flexibility. The few graphical programming languages that exist fall short because they try to replicate the semantics of text-based code but in graphical form. Lynx takes a different approach.
