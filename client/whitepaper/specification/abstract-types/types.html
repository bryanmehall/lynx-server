    <h2>Abstract Types</h2>
    In most languages, abstract types like sum types, product types and function types are first class concepts but in lynx they are subtypes of Lynx expressions. The meaning of the abstract types is given by their behavior upon evaluation. We will start with the simplest abstract types and then work towards the most general abstract types.
    A brief note on notation. \(a:A\) means a is a subtype of A.
    <h3 id="atom">Atoms</h3>
    \[Atom_\tau ::= \{...\} \:| \:\{a \:|\: a:(Attribute^*_\tau, Atom_\tau), ...\}\]
    Atoms (sometimes called unit types in other languages) are the building blocks of all abstract types in Lynx. They can be considered objects with no additional information. Any single concept you can think of is an atom. For example, the number zero is an atom. So is the number "3" , the letter "a" or the boolean "true". More complicated data structures like the entire friend connection graph on a social network at any given instant are also an atom. Any concept where there is exactly one of that type can be considered an atom with respect to its own type. 
    In Lynx, Atoms are just objects with no essential information. They can have meta-information and relations to other objects but this information can not change the meaning of the atom. We can form the following typing judgements for atoms:
    <div class="thm">Atomic Reflexivity</div>
    \[\frac{a: Atom_\tau}{a =_\tau a}\] What does it mean for it to be an atom in type tau? Do we want to say \(a:Atom \quad a:\tau\) or do we want to say that an object can be an atom in one type but not in another? ie. \(Nat = Zero | One | Two |Three...\) this would correctly make the statement \(Three:successor(Nat)\) 
    We can say that any two atoms of the same type that are definitionally equal to each other are equal to each other in the same type. This pattern is essential for reducing global complexity of code and its power will be more apparent when we introduce more complex types. If we have two developers working on the same concept without the knowledge of the other, this offers a mechanism to essentially merge the two concepts into one and ensure the correctness of all dependent code. We will start with a simple case of this for atoms and add more complex cases with more complex types.
    
    <div class="thm">Atomic Equality</div>
    \[\frac{a:Atom_\tau \quad b:Atom_\tau \quad a\equiv_\tau b}{a =_\tau b}\]

    An atom is an empty Lynx Object with no properties. Atoms form the leaves of Lynx Object trees. For example, The number is zero is an atom in the type of natural numbers. 
    How do lynx objects handle atoms and what do they look like? How do we formalize the transformation of a lynx expression into a lynx object?
    <h3>Binary Sum Types</h3>
    \[BinarySum ::=  \{(element_1, a:\link{lynx-expression}{LynxExpression}),(element_2, b:\link{lynx-expression}{LynxExpression}), ...\}\]
    While any concept in lynx can be represented as an Atom, programs constructed only from atoms would lack any structure. Let's first look at an example of a sum type of atoms. If we have two atoms called \(True\) and \(False\) then we can define a type called \(Boolean\) defined as \(Boolean = True \:|\: False\). If instances of the type \(Atom\) are defined as having exactly one possible value then the binary sum of two atoms has \(1+1 = 2\) inhabitants. This is where the name sum type comes from.
    
    Are Sum types defined as pattern matching on attributes? (we can say \(zero : nat\) and successor(nat) : nat. 
    nat = sumtype(zero, succ(nat))
    zero:nat, one:nat one:succ(zero) these don't need to be minimal but they do need to be consistent...What is the implementation of this and of the function search?
    Sum types are expressed in terms of the isA relation. We will use the natural numbers as an example. We can say that \(zero\) isA naturalNumber and we can say that for any natural number \(n\), \(n\).successor is a natural number. As alluded to in the design section, Lynx has a mechanism for programers to generalize concepts over time and simplify the program
    <object type="image/svg+xml" data="/whitepaper/specification/abstract-types/least-judgements.drawio.svg" class="diagram"></object>
    <div class="thm">Tagged Union Redundant Element Elimination </div>
    If the intersection of \(e_1\) and \(e_2\) is non-empty then 
    <div class="thm">Tagged Union Redundant Element Coherence </div>
    If a type \(\tau\) is defined as a tagged union of two other elements \(e_1\) and \(e_2\) then for every element \(a \in e_1\) and \(b \in e_2\) in the intersection of \(e_1\) and \(e_2\), \(a=_\tau b\)
    <h3>Binary Product Types</h3>
    \[BinaryProduct ::= \{(element_1, a:\link{lynx-expression}{LynxExpression}),(element_2, b:\link{lynx-expression}    {LynxExpression}), ...\}\]
    Binary Product types are defined with essential attributes on lynx objects so the product type \[\frac{a:LynxExpression \quad b:LynxExpression}{a \times b : }\]
    Product types can be subtyped to be atoms with the rule:
    \[\frac{a:Atom \quad b:Atom}{a\times b:Atom}\]
    This intuitively makes sense because an atom has one possible value so the product of two atoms is \(1\times1 = 1\) so it also has one possible value.

    <h3>Function Types \((\rightarrow)\)</h3>
    there should be a way to search for attributes. If we have an object \(a:A\) then for any function \(f:A \rightarrow B\) there should be an attribute-value pair \((f,b)\) on any Lynx Object of type \(A\) where \(b:B\)
    <h4>Isomorphism with attribute type</h4>
    <h4>Partial function interpretation </h4>
    Partial functions are denoted with the \(\rightharpoonup \) symbol. 

    <h3>Dependent Product Types \((\Pi)\)</h3>
    \[\prod_{x:A} B(x)\]
    Dependent product types are a generalization of functions and Product types
    As a generalization of product types: If we want to make the product type handle more than two inputs then we can rename the types in \(A \times B \times C...\) to \(\tau_0 \times \tau_1 \times \tau_2... \times \tau_i\) and restrict I to be a range of natural numbers \([0, i] = \{0, 1, 2, ...i\}\) then \[\tau_1 \times \tau_2... \times \tau_i =_\Pi \prod_{[0, i]} \tau_i\]

    <p>
        Types are used to constrain the behavior of programs and, when they are well-formed, ensure correctness within the boundaries of the type system. In some dynamically typed languages like javascript or python the typing is considered "weak" because there are very few rules about which objects can be used in which places. This is often seen as a feature because it is less confusing for beginners writing simple programs.
    </p>
    <p>
        Lynx takes the opposite approach. Type structures can always be relaxed selectively but when there is no type structure then the ability to reason about programs is lost. One way of thinking about it is that a weakly typed language can be created in a strongly typed language by purposefully relaxing all of the rules but the rules but a strongly typed language can not be replicated in a weakly typed language so the strongly typed language must be more expressive.

        <ul>
            <li>Problem #1: Types specify structure not behavior</li>
            <li>Problem #2: Equal types are not necessarily interchangeable</li>
            <li>Problem #3:  Data can only be an instance of a single type</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
        When we are programming is is useful to start defining types as the simple case and then creating a more general version later. This process of generalizations often gets programmers in trouble where they used a specific version of a type somewhere in their code and the new generalization breaks it. let's start with a very basic example. We can create a new object called "zero" and say it is an element of the natural numbers by adding a subtype (isA) relation between it and the "natural number" object.

    <p> 
        Now we can say "one is also a natural number" so we add the definition \(\text{One}: \text{Nat}\) and \(\text{Two}:\text{Nat}\)

    <h3>Type Theory</h3>
    To understand the lynx type system we first need some background in traditional type theory. Unlike types for languages like C++ or Java, types in lynx have a more formal structure. This chapter will be written without the expectation that you have any background in formal type theories and should be accessible to someone familiar with programming in dynamically typed languages like python or javascript. If you already know type theory you can skip this section and the section on Algebraic Data Types.
    <p>
        We will use construction of a coordinate point as a motivating example throughout this chapter. A coordinate point consists of an x-coordinate and a y coordinate and can be written as a pair (x,y). Notice that this contains two pieces of information: an x-coordinate that is a number and a y-coordinate that is a number. We will use the notation \(x: \text{Number}\) (read "\(x\) is of type number") as a shorthand. With this notation we can also say, \(y: \text{Number}\) and \((x, y):\text{CoordinatePoint}\).
    </p>
    <p>
        Formal type theory has different kinds of rules that describe how types are formed and used. We will introduce 3 types of rules: introduction rules, elimination rules and computation rules.

        <ol>
            <li>The Introduction rule describes how a type is constructed</li>
            <li>The Elimination rule describes how a type that is already constructed can be broken back apart into its pieces</li>
            <li>The Computation rule checks that the introduction rules match with the elimination rules and creates a way to "run" these types as programs</li>
        </ol>
    </p>
    <h4>Introduction Rules</h4>
    <p>
        Given we have something called x that is a number and we have something called y that is a number we can create a coordinate point \((x, y)\). The notation we use for this in type theory is: \[\frac{x:\text{Number} \quad y:\text{Number}}{(x, y):\text{CoordinatePoint}}\] The text above the line are the assumptions required for the text below the line to be true. So to create a coordinate point we need a number \(x\) and a number \(y\). Assuming we have both of these we can create a coordinate point.
    </p>
    <h4>Elimination Rules</h4>
    <p>
        Elimination rules are sort of the inverse of introduction rules. They ask "given that we already have a coordinate point, what information can we pull out of it?" In this case there two elimination rules that we'll call \(E_1\) and \(E_2\):\[\begin{align} \frac{(x, y):\text{CoordinatePoint}}{x:\text{Number}}(E_1) && \frac{(x, y):\text{CoordinatePoint}}{ y:\text{Number}}\left(E_2\right)\end{align}\] \(E_1\) says that we if we have a coordinate point we can extract an x coordinate that is of type number and  \(E_2\) says that we can also extract a y-coordinate of type number. Notice that these elimination rules are a sort of inverse to the introduction rule. The introduction rule shows how to put pieces together and the elimination rule shows how to take them back apart. This concept will be made more formal with the computation rule.If all of this seems too basic to you, consider this: Even though these rules are simple and may seem trivial, they form a structure of types that can be checked by a computer. As types get more complicated, the computer can check that the programmer has handled every case and that the types fit together. The mechanization this allows is the important part
