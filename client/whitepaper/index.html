                Lynx is a computable specification language designed to make building great software more intuitive and efficient. Programming is fundamentally about human communication.  After a brief discussion about the philosophy behind Lynx and what a programming ecosystem should look like, this document will detail the operational semantics of the Lynx language.

                The Lynx language is an attempt to rebuild the programing ecosystem from first principles.

                Objects in lynx are stored as trees but to be able to do computation we need to add a few concepts. The big idea is that the program we are running and the result we are trying to arrive at already exist in the tree an we only need to move from one to the other.  To make this more concrete, let's introduce the concept of a "cursor" that can be thought of as our current position in the tree. In these diagrams we will highlight the cursor in blue. We will call the combination of a lynx object tree and a cursor an expression.
