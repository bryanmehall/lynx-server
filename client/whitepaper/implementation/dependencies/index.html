<h3>Dependencies</h3>
In the type LynxExpression, the set of dependencies for a given expression \(e\) is a set of references \(\{r_0, r_1, ...\}\)

<h4>Update Types</h4>
How do these determine if variables range over variables or values? 
<h5>Push</h5>
Objects keep list of dependents. For every event, dispatch events to each dependent.
<h5>Poll</h5>

<h5>Pull</h5>
Whenever a view is requested, get a value and if a value is tagged with an update then retrieve the update instead. Identity is based off of definitions and therefore dependencies.
