    <p>    
        Traditional text-based coding is the standard that almost every general purpose programming language uses because of its expressive power and flexibility. It provides a consistent interface for every program and the text that is visible is the entirety of the implementation. The few graphical programming languages that exist fall short because they try to replicate the semantics of text-based code but in graphical form. Lynx takes a different approach.

        Lynx offers features for determining how the result of a program was defined built into the language. Say a programmer is implementing a collision detection algorithm but it isn't working properly...introspect into how the collision boolean was defined instead fo stepping forward through imperative code to the point of the error
        When combined with graphical representations of each of these concepts this forms an extremely powerful debugging tool
