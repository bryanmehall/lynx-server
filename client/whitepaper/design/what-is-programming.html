    <p>
        When most people think about programming they think about writing code. Instead, it should be thought of in a more abstract way as the act of communicating complex ideas precisely. With traditional programming languages, programmers are really doing two separate acts at the same time: Writing code to communicate with computers and writing documentation to communicate with other programmers. These two parts are held together with an informal set of best practices that are but they should be unified within a programming environment.
