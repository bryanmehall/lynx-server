        Predicated isomorphism
objects in lynx are considered equal if there is an isomorphism between them. The "is a" relation is formed by an isomoprhism with a predicate on it.
for example, a string is a list where the elements of the list are of type character. another way of phrasing this is given that the elements of a list are
of type character then the type list is equal to the type string. Similarly the type "list of length 3" is a list because it forms an isomorphism with
lists predicated on the length being 3.
This provides a solution to the dreaded diamond problem in traditional object oriented programming. In the diagram above we can say that the type
"string of length 3" satisfies the "is a" relationship with the type "string" and "list of length 3" but these "is a" relations have data attached to them that
ensures any subtypes of them will abide by the properties of all parent objects.
